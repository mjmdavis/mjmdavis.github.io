Currently [teaching myself to program in 10 years](http://norvig.com/21-days.html).

I've worked at [DFKI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Research_Centre_for_Artificial_Intelligence) and [John Deere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Deere).

I've been a Software Engineer, Integrator, Tech Lead and Independent Contributor in teams varying in size from 2-400.

I've worked professionally on Mobile (iOS), Embedded (Windows, Linux), Web, Automation and Data Analysis.

I'm proud of bootstrapping GitHub Enterprise at John Deere and bringing it to thousands of developers.

I aspire to spend my career learning.
